## Light Modes

ðŸŽ¨ = Supports color palette, rainbow, or randoms.
C1/C2/C3 = Uses color 1, 2, 3  
ðŸªŸ = Overlay  - writes atop an existing strips data  
ðŸ”§ = Modifier - modifies the brightness or indices of an existing strips data  
ðŸ§± = Base Layer - can only be used as a foundation for other modes, not as an overlay or modifier

Improvements: 
- Shift amount, merge Blink and Breathe vs Fade, swipe merge w sweep using persist(overridePixelIndex)
- effect_blend - Selects every n pixels to blend sideways
- Perlin / random selected indices for bleaching and such
- Segmenting
- Bezier/ sigmoid for all speed intensity fade etc.

> Juggle, Bouncing Balls, Meteor, Tetrix can use a common underlying function that animates moving objects (dots, balls, blocks) w (position, speed, trail, and color). 
> Plasma and Perlin Move can share a noise-based rendering function with different parameters. 
> Stream and Palette are more pattern-based, but could use a shared function for color cycling or zone-based coloring.
