    "> The startup process initializes the LED strip controller by setting up serial communication, configuring the LED strip parameters (length, brightness, color order), and allocating memory for the strip data structures. It then instantiates the Bluetooth process by calling `initializeBLE`, which prepares the device for wireless communication. Only after these steps are complete does the main loop begin, allowing the system to respond to incoming messages and update the LED strip in real time. This ensures that all hardware and communication interfaces are ready before any data processing or animation occurs."

It takes a JSON string and parses it into the `myData` structure, updating fields such as brightness, colors, mode, and other parameters. If parsing is successful, it sets `myData.updated = true`, signaling that new data has arrived and the LED strip should be refreshed with the new settings.

    "> The `handleStrip` function is the core routine that manages updates to the LED strip. When `myData.updated` is true, it refreshes the strip settings, copies the previous data for transitions, and prepares the strip for new effects. It then calls `callModeFunction`, which applies the selected lighting mode based on the current configuration. The strip is updated either directly or through blending, depending on the value of `transitionValue`. If a transition is in progress, colors are smoothly blended between the old and new states. The `updated` parameter acts as a trigger, ensuring that changes are only processed when new data arrives, making the system responsive to Bluetooth or other input events."
