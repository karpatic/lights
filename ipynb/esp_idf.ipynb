    "## ESP-IDF vs Arduino-ESP32: Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### What they are:\n",
    "- **ESP-IDF**: Official SDK by Espressif, built on FreeRTOS\n",
    "- **Arduino-ESP32**: Wrapper around ESP-IDF with Arduino-style APIs\n",
    "- **Arduino IDE**: Development environment (separate from libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Arduino-ESP32:\n",
    "- **Beginners** and simple hobby projects\n",
    "- **Low barrier to entry** with extensive ecosystem\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility** (STM32, AVR, ESP8266, etc.)\n",
    "- Simple applications (sensor data + basic control)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use ESP-IDF:\n",
    "- **Serious embedded development**\n",
    "- **Complex applications** requiring multiple peripherals\n",
    "- **Performance-critical** projects\n",
    "- **Task-based architecture** (vs setup/loop pattern)\n",
    "- **Direct access** to all ESP32 features\n",
    "- **Reliability-critical** environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Technical Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Arduino-ESP32 | ESP-IDF |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|---------|\n",
    "| Architecture | setup() + loop() | Task-based (FreeRTOS) |\n",
    "| Learning Curve | Easy | Moderate |\n",
    "| Performance | Good | Excellent |\n",
    "| Feature Access | Limited | Complete |\n",
    "| Debugging | Through wrapper | Direct |\n",
    "| Code Organization | Simple | Component-based |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best of Both Worlds:\n",
    "You can combine both approaches:\n",
    "- Use **PlatformIO + VS Code** as IDE\n",
    "- Include **Arduino libraries as ESP-IDF components**\n",
    "- Access ESP-IDF functions when needed\n",
    "- Example: `pinMode()` alongside `gpio_set_direction()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "- **Start with Arduino-ESP32** for learning and prototyping\n",
    "- **Migrate to ESP-IDF** when projects become complex\n",
    "- **Use PlatformIO** for better development experience than Arduino IDE"
