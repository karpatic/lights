And WDS is universally disabled out-of-the box. Many cheaper routers don't have WDS at all. Plus, there are different incompatible flavours of WDS. Finally, there is question of WDS/4addr mode support on ESP8266 itself - in theory, there is some support in SDK, but I haven't seen any working application code doing it.\n",

    "ESP-MESH Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy setup: ESP-MESH expands the original Wi-Fi hotspot range to the reach of the most distant node in the mesh cloud. Such a network is automatically formed, self-healing and self-organizing. It saves the efforts of laying cables. All you need to do is configure the router password.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gateway free: The decentralized structure of ESP-MESH with the absence of a gateway precludes the overall network breakdown if one single node fails. Even if there is a single ESP-MESH device, the network still works as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- unicast, multicast and broadcast transmissions are supported\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large network capacity: ESP-MESH takes the form of a tree topology, so one single device can connect to 10 devices at maximum, and an entire network can have over 1,000 nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wider transmission coverage: The transmission distance between two devices is 30 m through walls, and 200 m without any obstacles in between (relevant to ESP32-DevKitC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- High transmission speed: For Wi-Fi transmission, the speed can reach up to 10 Mbps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simultaneously run Wi-Fi and BLE protocol stacks: ESP32 chips can run both Wi-Fi and BLE protocol stacks side by side and use ESP-MESH as the main network to transmit data, receive BLE probe beacon, send BLE broadcasts and connect BLE devices.\n",

    "MQTT can run over various transport layers like TCP/IP, mesh networks, or Bluetooth. While Bluetooth isn't an application protocol like HTTP or MQTT, it can carry them or operate independently using its own profiles (e.g., GATT for BLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP, in contrast, requires a reliable, connection-oriented transport (like TCP/IP) and can't function without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of MQTT is its asynchronous message handling: the broker can queue and forward messages even if a client is temporarily disconnected. Once the client reconnects, it can receive any missed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT uses a compact binary packet format, minimizing payload size compared to HTTP/REST, which use text-based formats like ASCII or Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection overhead is minimalâ€”establishing a session takes ~80 bytes, and each publish/subscribe message can be as small as 20 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency between a message being published and delivered to subscribers is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a single, persistent socket connection, which reduces overhead and enables high-speed communication. This makes it suitable for large-scale, mobile-first systems like Facebook Messenger.\n",
