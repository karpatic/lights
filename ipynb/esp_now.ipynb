    "MQTT can run over various transport layers like TCP/IP, mesh networks, or Bluetooth. While Bluetooth isn't an application protocol like HTTP or MQTT, it can carry them or operate independently using its own profiles (e.g., GATT for BLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP, in contrast, requires a reliable, connection-oriented transport (like TCP/IP) and can't function without it.a\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of MQTT is its asynchronous message handling: the broker can queue and forward messages even if a client is temporarily disconnected. Once the client reconnects, it can receive any missed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT uses a compact binary packet format, minimizing payload size compared to HTTP/REST, which use text-based formats like ASCII or Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection overhead is minimal—establishing a session takes ~80 bytes, and each publish/subscribe message can be as small as 20 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency between a message being published and delivered to subscribers is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a single, persistent socket connection, which reduces overhead and enables high-speed communication. This makes it suitable for large-scale, mobile-first systems like Facebook Messenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, keeping a socket open consumes some resources. MQTT allows flexibility—clients can reconnect only when needed to publish, depending on your application’s needs.\n",
