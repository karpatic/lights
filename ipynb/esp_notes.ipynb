    "#### Key Features\n",
    "- Background noise filtering (or squelch).\n",
    "- The ESP32 uses a 12-bit ADC.\n",

    "#### INMP441 Notes\n",
    "- Leave the MAX4466 gain untouched; it works fine out of the box.\n",
    "- A MAX4466 and INMP401 should average about **1875** on an ESP32, while a MAX9814 averages about **1350** for all gain settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Options\n",
    "- **Adafruit**: $6.95 - [Electret Microphone Amp - MAX4466](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063) with Adjustable Gain.\n",
    "- **Digikey**: $7.95 - [Electret Microphone Amp Audio Evaluation Board - MAX9814](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/1713/4990777?s=N4IgjCBcoLQBxVAYygMwIYBsDOBTANCAPZQDa4ArAEwIC6AvvYVWeAOxgDMIDQA).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Analog vs. I2S Digital Microphones\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Use an I2S digital microphone with ESP32 boards, such as INMP441, ICS-43434, or PDM microphones.\n",
    "- **Analog Input**:\n",
    "    - Possible but may experience power fluctuation (3.3V) and noise issues.\n",
    "    - Analog devices are handled by the \"ADC1\" unit of the ESP32, which can cause problems when connecting other analog devices (e.g., potentiometers) to the same ADC1 unit.\n",
    "    - Analog microphones like MAX4466 work best when placed very close to the sound source (30-50cm optimal distance).\n",
    "- **Digital Input**:\n",
    "    - Digital microphones like INMP441 can pick up sound from several meters away.\n",
    "    - On ESP32, use I2S microphones such as INMP441, SPH0645, or ICS-43434.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "- Avoid powering LED strips from the ESP32's 3.3V or 5V pins.\n",
    "- Do not use USB power from your PC for LED strips.\n",
    "- Isolate the power between LED strips and the controller.\n",
    "- Some batches of analog microphones may have quality issues.\n",
    "- The ESP32 and ESP8266 boards often experience spurious noise on their ADC pins."
