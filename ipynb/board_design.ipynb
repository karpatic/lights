    "- JST connectors should be used for all peripherals. Will require a **capacitor** and **resistor** for driving LEDs.\n",

    "- Avoid powering LED strips from the ESP32's 3.3V or 5V pins.\n",
    "- Do not use USB power from your PC for LED strips.\n",
    "- Isolate the power between LED strips and the controller.\n",

    "#### Analog vs. I2S Digital Microphones\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Use an I2S digital microphone with ESP32 boards, such as INMP441, ICS-43434, or PDM microphones.\n",
    "- **Analog Input**:\n",
    "    - Possible but may experience power fluctuation (3.3V) and noise issues.\n",
    "    - Analog devices are handled by the \"ADC1\" unit of the ESP32, which can cause problems when connecting other analog devices (e.g., potentiometers) to the same ADC1 unit.\n",
    "    - Analog microphones like MAX4466 work best when placed very close to the sound source (30-50cm optimal distance).\n",
    "- **Digital Input**:\n",
    "    - Digital microphones like INMP441 can pick up sound from several meters away.\n",
    "    - On ESP32, use I2S microphones such as INMP441, SPH0645, or ICS-43434.\n",

    "* **Mechanical Features**: Slots, cut-outs, millings, and V-cuts must be on the same layer as the board outline.\n",
    "* **Silkscreen Texts**: Minimum line width 0.15mm; height ≥0.8mm for clarity.\n",
    "* **Repeat Orders**: Production files from previous orders are reused without changes. Do not add modification notes.\n",

    "* **Tooling Holes**: Must appear in the solder paste layer.\n",

    "* EasyEDA supports only double-layer designs by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For single-layer PCB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Layout everything on one side.\n",
    "2. Ignore other-side pads.\n",
    "3. Generate Gerber.\n",
    "4. Add a comment during order indicating it's a single-layer design.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Typically white, used for component IDs, test points, part numbers, warnings, logos, date codes.\n",

    "* Specify placement/omission of these if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stencil vs PCBA\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stencil**: Used for manual solder paste application; cost-effective.\n",
    "* **PCBA**: Requires full BOM and incurs higher cost due to assembly."
