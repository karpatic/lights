    "## The ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ESP-IDF is the official development framework for ESP32 series chips, providing comprehensive APIs and tools for embedded development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Official Documentation:** https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "### ESP-IDF vs Arduino-ESP32: Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What they are:\n",
    "- **ESP-IDF**: Official SDK by Espressif, built on FreeRTOS\n",
    "- **Arduino-ESP32**: Wrapper around ESP-IDF with Arduino-style APIs\n",
    "- **Arduino IDE**: Development environment (separate from libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use Arduino-ESP32:\n",
    "- **Beginners** and simple hobby projects\n",
    "- **Low barrier to entry** with extensive ecosystem\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility** (STM32, AVR, ESP8266, etc.)\n",
    "- Simple applications (sensor data + basic control)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use ESP-IDF:\n",
    "- **Serious embedded development**\n",
    "- **Complex applications** requiring multiple peripherals\n",
    "- **Performance-critical** projects\n",
    "- **Task-based architecture** (vs setup/loop pattern)\n",
    "- **Direct access** to all ESP32 features\n",
    "- **Reliability-critical** environments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Technical Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Arduino-ESP32 | ESP-IDF |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|---------|\n",
    "| Architecture | setup() + loop() | Task-based (FreeRTOS) |\n",
    "| Learning Curve | Easy | Moderate |\n",
    "| Performance | Good | Excellent |\n",
    "| Feature Access | Limited | Complete |\n",
    "| Debugging | Through wrapper | Direct |\n",
    "| Code Organization | Simple | Component-based |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best of Both Worlds:\n",
    "You can combine both approaches:\n",
    "- Use **PlatformIO + VS Code** as IDE\n",
    "- Include **Arduino libraries as ESP-IDF components**\n",
    "- Access ESP-IDF functions when needed\n",
    "- Example: `pinMode()` alongside `gpio_set_direction()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendation:\n",
    "- **Start with Arduino-ESP32** for learning and prototyping\n",
    "- **Migrate to ESP-IDF** when projects become complex\n",
    "- **Use PlatformIO** for better development experience than Arduino IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "### ESP-IDF Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the [official setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) for detailed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install Prerequisites\n",
    "- Special ones for [Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-setup.html)\n",
    "- Fix the Permission issues for `/dev/ttyUSB0`\n",
    "- Set up Python 3 as default for Ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Git Clone ESP-IDF\n",
    "Clone ESP-IDF into `~/esp/esp-idf`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Set Up the Tools\n",
    "- Run `./install.sh` to setup compilation tools required by ESP-IDF into the user home directory (`$HOME/.espressif` on Linux)\n",
    "- If you wish to install the tools into a different directory, set the environment variable `IDF_TOOLS_PATH` before running the installation scripts. Make sure that your user account has sufficient permissions to read and write this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables\n",
    "- ESP-IDF provides another script which does that: `export.sh`\n",
    "- If you plan to use esp-idf frequently, you can create a `.bashrc` alias for executing `export.sh`\n",
    "- Now you can run `get_idf` to set up or refresh the esp-idf environment in any terminal session.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Start A Project\n",
    "- Find an [Example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/esp \n",
    "cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Connect Your Device\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls /dev/tty*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Configure\n",
    "- Navigate to the Project Directory from Step 5\n",
    "- Run the project configuration utility menuconfig\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/esp/hello_world\n",
    "idf.py set-target esp32\n",
    "idf.py menuconfig\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Setting the target with `idf.py set-target esp32` should be done once, after opening a new project. (If the project contains some existing builds and configuration, they will be cleared and initialized)"

    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install git wget libncurses-dev flex bison gperf python python-pip python-setuptools python-serial python-cryptography python-future python-pyparsing python-pyelftools cmake ninja-build ccache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the Toolchain\n",
    "\n",
    "ESP32 toolchain for Linux is available for download from Espressif website:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract the Toolchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Then extract it in `~/esp` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/esp\n",
    "cd ~/esp\n",
    "# If you clicked the link:\n",
    "tar -xzf ~/Downloads/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Your PATH Environment Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolchain will be extracted into `~/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you will need to update your PATH environment variable in `~/.profile` file. To make `xtensa-esp32-elf` available for all terminal sessions, add the following line to your `~/.profile` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo geany ~/.profile\n",
    "# Add this line:\n",
    "export PATH=\"$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "# Then reload:\n",
    "source ~/.profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative: Create an Alias\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may create an alias for the above command. This way you can get the toolchain only when you need it. Then when you need the toolchain you can type `get_esp32` on the command line and the toolchain will be added to your PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, add different line to your `~/.profile` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo geany ~/.profile\n",
    "# Add this line:\n",
    "alias get_esp32='export PATH=\"$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:$PATH\"'\n",
    "# Then reload:\n",
    "source ~/.profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you have `/bin/bash` set as login shell, and both `.bash_profile` and `.profile` exist, then update `.bash_profile` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log off and log in back to make the `.profile` changes effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `/home/user-name` there should be a home path specific to your installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to verify if PATH is correctly set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "printenv PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permission Issues `/dev/ttyUSB0`\n",
    "\n",
    "With some Linux distributions you may get the \"Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0\" error message when flashing the ESP32. This can be solved by adding the current user to the dialout group.\n",

    "\n",
    "ESP-MESH is a networking protocol that allows multiple ESP32 devices to form a self-healing wireless mesh network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- Self-organizing and self-healing network topology\n",
    "- Router-based networking requirement\n",
    "- Root node election based on RSSI to target SSID\n",
    "- Maximum network scalability with multiple nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations:\n",
    "- A router is mandatory during ESP-MESH networking\n",
    "- Users need to configure the Service Set Identification (SSID), password and channel of the router for each node\n",
    "- Root node election is determined partly by the best RSSI to the target SSID\n",
    "- Edge nodes that can't hear the SSID may default to worst RSSI and resolve their position using tie breakers\n",
