    "Point-to-point is a network topology used for establishing one-to-one (1:1) device communications. The point-to-point topology available on Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) is optimized for audio streaming and is ideally suited for a wide range of wireless devices, such as speakers, headsets, and hands-free car kits. The point-to-point topology available on Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) is optimized for data transfer and is well suited for connected device products, such as fitness trackers, health monitors, and PC peripherals and accessories.\n",
