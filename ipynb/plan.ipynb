    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A single ESP32 connects via Bluetooth to your phone, and the nodes, possibly multiple, communicate via a mesh network. They message each other using a protocol called ESP-NOW. To establish ESP-NOW links, the nodes broadcast their presence using their soft-AP functionality, allowing them to exchange MAC addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mesh Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- A node first scans for an existing mesh network. If none is found, it opens itself for Bluetooth connections.\n",
    "- If part of a mesh, the node creates a Soft Access Point (AP) and starts broadcasting its presence.\n",
    "- The ESP32 creates an AP with both its SSID and password starting with ESP32.\n",
    "- Each node maintains a routing table containing the MAC addresses of all nodes in its subnetwork (including itself), partitioned into subtables for each child node’s subnetwork.\n",
    "- Any addition or removal of nodes triggers a user notification.\n",
    "- Nodes can mesh across networks owned by different users and share information by scanning for other APs and reporting them to their (gateway) node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only admin may broadcast.\n",
    "2. Gateway sends to children.\n",
    "3. Children do not message siblings.\n",
    "4. One relative per broadcast; prioritize gateway.\n",
    "5. Children deliver inbound messages to gateway.\n",
    "6. Gateway delivers data to admin, return to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Broadcasts limited by hop count (`#hops`) managed by gateway.\n",
    "* Gateways broadcast user commands.\n",
    "* Leafs unicast out, not to each other.\n",
    "* Users config determins what messages to relay from others.\n",
    "* Pub/sub design allows routing and optional replication of messages.\n",
    "* Peers broadcast to all peers `FF:FF:FF:FF`\n",
    "* Set peer MAC address -> broadcast via shared MAC. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "* Command → STA → `WifiMacAddr()`\n",
    "* Satellite → AP → `WifiSoftAPMacAddr()`\n",
    "* Channels: 0–14, 2.4GHz (802.11n)\n",
    "* Max paired devices: 20\n",
    "* Circumvent unicasting by using common MAC addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Service`, `Characteristic`\n",
    "* `EspOwnerName`, `EspDeviceName`\n",
    "* `Pin` (e.g., 13, 2)\n",
    "* `LED` #\n",
    "* `SSIDConnectorNamePrefix`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MidiEvent()` → keypress DJ pad → `AudioEvent()`\n",
    "* `AudioEvent()` → `Meyda()`\n",
    "* `Meyda()` → `LightEvent()`\n",
    "* `LightEvent()` → `audioFX(userName, [colors, duration, variation, intensity, transition])`\n",
    "* Slider knobs adjust: Volume, High, Mid, Low\n",
    "* Start/Stop functionality with display\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization & Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pseudocode\n",
    "on_start:\n",
    "  load settings from storage\n",
    "  try connect to preferred network\n",
    "  except: scan_or_establish_default_network()\n",
    "\n",
    "default_network_loop():\n",
    "  if disconnected: scan_or_establish_default_network()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ConfigDeviceAP(mac=ssid, pass=1234)` — prints confirmation.\n",
    "2. `RegisterCallbacks(msg_sent, msg_received)` — handles writing to pins.\n",
    "3. `InitESPNow(on_msg_sent, on_msg_received)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `strip.begin()`\n",
    "   * `strip.show()`\n",
    "   * BLEESP Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Create Service and Characteristic.\n",
    "     * Register Callbacks.\n",
    "     * Set Value.\n",
    "     * Start BLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scan for leaf nodes**: `WiFi.scanNetwork()` and for each AP named `espname`, add to list.\n",
    "2. **Manage leaf nodes**: Check pairing with nodes named `espname`.\n",
    "3. **Send Data**\n",
    "4. **Command Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### BLE and ESP Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OnBLEReceived`: If `leafnodes`, broadcast via ESPNow and execute command.\n",
    "* `OnESPReceived`: If BLE not connected → do nothing. Otherwise, forward to BLE if valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Config Device AP\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scan for leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If node with `esp.bt` exists and not connected to user → gateway exists.\n",
    "* Manage leaf nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to connect via Bluetooth.\n",
    "  * On success, modify Wi-Fi name to include `bt` (indicating gateway).\n",
    "* `espnow_senddata(command)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If not leader → don’t send.\n",
    "  * Leader-only data reading.\n",
    "  * Non-leaders may send, but leaders are authoritative.\n",
